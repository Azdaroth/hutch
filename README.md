# Hutch

A system for processing messages from RabbitMQ.


## Defining Consumers

Consumers receive messages from a RabbitMQ queue. That queue may be bound to
one or more topics (represented by routing keys).

To create a consumer, include the `Hutch::Consumer` module in a class that
defines a `#process` method. `#process` should take a single argument, which
will be a `Message` object. The `Message` object encapsulates the message data,
along with any associated metadata. To access properties of the message, use
Hash-style indexing syntax:

```ruby
message[:id]  # => "02ABCXYZ"
```

To subscribe to a topic, pass a routing key to `consume` in the class
definition. To bind to multiple routing keys, simply pass extra routing keys
in as additional arguments. Refer to the [RabbitMQ docs on topic exchanges][1]
for more information about how to use routing keys. Here's an example consumer:

```ruby
class FailedPaymentConsumer
  include Hutch::Consumer
  consume 'gc.ps.payment.failed'

  def process(message)
    mark_payment_as_failed(message[:id])
  end
end
```
